# ZBOT-Botnet / Zeus-Botnet
# Requirements: CentOS 6.8/6.9 x64 Server

Botnets are illegal, very illegal. Across the globe

Especially ones that are programmed to perform denial of service attacks.

# DISCLAIMER
I'm not giving any tutorials on the setup process, If you would like more information on it;
